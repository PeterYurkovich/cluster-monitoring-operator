|evaluationInterval|string|Configures the default interval between Prometheus rule evaluations in case the `PrometheusRule` resource does not specify any value. The interval must be set between 5 seconds and 5 minutes. The value can be expressed in: seconds (for example `30s`.), minutes (for example `1m`.) or a mix of minutes and seconds (for example `1m30s`.). It applies to `PrometheusRule` resources without the `openshift.io/prometheus-rule-evaluation-scope=\"leaf-prometheus\"` label. The default value is `15s`.

|nodeSelector|map[string]string|Defines the nodes on which the Pods are scheduled.

|resources|*v1.ResourceRequirements|Defines resource requests and limits for the Thanos Ruler container.

This definition must be specified using the following regular expression pattern: `[0-9]+(ms\|s\|m\|h\|d\|w\|y)` (ms = milliseconds, s= seconds,m = minutes, h = hours, d = days, w = weeks, y = years). The default value is `24h`.

|tolerations|[]v1.Toleration|Defines tolerations for the pods.
